<div class="container privacypage"> The following privacy policy applies to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address, or e-mail address. <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  gwizz.co collects a limited amount of non-personal information that your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. It includes your IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your visits, and cookie that may identify your browser.  We use this information for our internal use only. <br>
  <br>
  gwizz.co requires you to register for an account to become a customer. When you register, personal information is collected and stored in our system. This information is necessary to provide membership services. Your personal information will not be shared outside of gwizz.co. <br>
  <br>

<h2>GDPR Legitimate Interest:</h2>


<strong>Identify a legitimate Interest</strong><br>
  The Information Commissioner's Office in <a href="
https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/legitimate-interests/" target="_blank">Recital 47</a> has stated that “The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.”<br>
  <br>
<strong>Show that the processing is necessary to achieve it</strong><br>
We are small tech company with less than 200 employees. We have developed a software product that aids email marketers with their marketing efforts more effectively. Our product is competitive and affordable and the processing of the data is essential to spread the word to a relevant and wide scale audience. It’s not intrusive in any way - the purpose of our communication is to help email marketers save time and money while improving their marketing efforts. Recipients can unsubscribe from our emails at any stage and then they will not receive any further emails from us or any of our resellers.<br>
<br>
<strong>Balance it against the individual's, rights and freedoms</strong><br>


“(47) The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller.”<br>
<br>
Contacts we are emailing are acquired from an opt-in lead source. We are connecting with industry appropriate contacts to market our software products to – ie connecting with affiliates, email marketers, or those who have expressed interest in internet marketing to market our email marketing software product, GWiZZ.<br>
<br>
 

Therefore it is a “reasonable expectation” those who have subscribed, registering an interest in email marketing will expect to receive further information about internet marketing. These marketing emails have a “minimal privacy impact” as each one has a clear option to unsubscribe from further marketing communications.<br>
<br>
